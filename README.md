// How do I approach designing software? --- \\
When designing software, I start by breaking down the problem into smaller parts and identifying what features or elements are most important. 
I imagine the overall structure first, then think about how each piece will fit together. 
I always try to plan before I code, whether itâ€™s with diagrams, notes, or just visualizing the steps in my head.

// What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft? --- \\
This project taught me how to look at a real scene and figure out how to recreate it using basic 3D shapes. 
I learned how to use references for scale and proportion, and how to select textures and materials that make models look more realistic. 
I also got better at organizing my code and keeping things modular, so each part of the scene could be adjusted or reused easily.

// What design process did you follow for your project work? --- \\
I started by studying reference images, loading into the map and walking around to look at the lighting details and deciding which objects were most important to the scene. 
Then I made a list of shapes I needed, sketched their positions and sizes, and experimented with their placement in code. 
As I built up the scene, I constantly referred back to the images to make sure everything matched as closely as possible.

// --- How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work? --- \\
Breaking down big problems into small tasks, using references, and testing ideas step-by-step can help with any design project. 
Keeping my code organized and modular will make future projects easier to manage and expand. 
Also, constantly checking my progress against my original goals helps me stay on track.
